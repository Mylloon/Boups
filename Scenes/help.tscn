If you have made it this far, you've been selected
for an important mission:
	Get rid of our greatest enemy, Macreye.
He is an extremely powerful individual who has been forcing
his way of thinking for decades.
He keeps us under control with his huge hands and 
his almost omnipresent eye.
Recently, one of our spies managed to connect to his system
but did not manage to destroy it.
Your task is to infiltrate the system and destroy all the files on Macreye's system
without Macreye's system without his knowledge.

[How to Play ]
There are 3 types of elements to click on:
- Folder 
	When you click on it, a button appears.
	This button allows you to uninstall the contents of the folder
	This takes time, sometimes you have to stop the execution
	to avoid being noticed.
	Warning: if you close the window, the download will still be in progress.
- Classic file
	Works in the same way as the folder.
- Terminal icon
	This icon works the same way as the others elements.

[Note]
It is possible to launch several files at the same time.

Good luck soldier!"
